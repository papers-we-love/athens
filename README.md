# Papers We ❤️ Athens

This is the repository for the Athens chapter of Papers We Love.

We intend to be using this repository for coordinating with people who want to give presentations in the local meetups. We will be updating this document with the details as soon as possible!

As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/athens/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
